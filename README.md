# Level 1 - 03 : Pacman

## Level 1 training serie

I'm learning how to code video game. To train myself, I decided to mimic the level 1 of some game. The code will remain in the state it has been written. I don't want to infinitly refacor and imporve the code. I'll progress through the serie.

## Tools

- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) / GDScript
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)

## Left of the side

- The different types of enemies

## What did I learn

- State machine used to implement the player movement,
- Nagivation 2D to implement path finding of the enemies chasing the player.
